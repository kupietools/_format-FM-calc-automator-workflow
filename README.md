# _format-FM-calc-automator-workflow
An Automator workflow for OS X which creats a system service that visually formats FileMaker Pro calculations for easy readability.

Unzip the archive and place this workflow in your /Users/[yourname]/Services folder to add "_Format FM Calc" to your Services menu (usually available either with a mouse right-click or as a submenu of the Application menu in most apps after the Apple menu in your menu bar.)

After unzipping, you will want to open this in Automator and look at it before you add it to your Services folder. Just look at it so you see it's innocent and does what it says, and there's nothing tricky about it. This is just a good habit, for security. Don't go adding things to your system because a stranger on github said you can. 

The original source code of the PERL script that does the formatting is visible as plain text once you open it within Automator too, if you want to see that. 

# Credits

This is substantially based on calculation_formatter.pl by Debi Fuchs <debi@aptworks.com> which was originally shared by Filemaker Inc in their Development Conventions PDF whitepaper in Nov. 2005, then heavily customized by me to make code clearer and keep up with changes in FM's calculation formatting beginning in 2012 forwards, as well as my own visual formatting. There are comments in the PERL code giving some info on my changes.
